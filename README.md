## Latent Representation


Nice to meet you, I am a Chinese student currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at Ajou University, Republic of Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Wonjun Hwang since September 2021. Prior to that, I earned my BS degree in Telecommunications from Jeju National University and my MS degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My research interests during my Ph.D. studies include neural network quantization and knowledge distillation for image analysis.

And also, I love Mountaineering ðŸ—» and Photography ðŸ“¸.
