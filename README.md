# 👋👋 Hello there, I'm Jie Xu

## 1) Latent Representation


Nice to meet you! 

I am a Chinese student pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at Ajou University in Korea. I have been under the supervision of Prof. Wonjun Hwang since September 2021.    My research interests during my Ph.D. studies include neural network quantization and knowledge distillation using a variational Bayesian Learning approach method for image analysis. Prior to that, I obtained a B.E. degree in Telecommunications and an M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Jeju National University in Korea in 2021.

And also, I love Mountaineering 🗻 and Photography 📸. I have visited my hometown mountains like 'Huang Shan', 'Zi Peng Shan', and 'Xiao Bie Shan' all in An Hui province; And also, visited '한라산' three times on Jeju island in South Korea.
