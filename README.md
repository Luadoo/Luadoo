# 👋👋 Hello there, I'm Jie Xu

## 1) Latent Representation


Nice to meet you! 

I am a Chinese student pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at Ajou University in Korea. I have been under the supervision of Prof. Wonjun Hwang since September 2021.    My research interests during my Ph.D. studies include neural network quantization and knowledge distillation using a variational Bayesian Learning approach method for image analysis. Before that, I obtained a B.E. degree in Telecommunications and an M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Jeju National University in Korea in 2021.

My recent research topic: Uncertainty-aware Binary Neural Networks.

And also, I also love mountaineering 🗻 and photography 📸. I have visited mountains in my hometown, such as 'Huang Shan,' 'Zi Peng Shan,' and 'Xiao Bie Shan,' all located in Anhui Province. Additionally, I've visited '한라산' three times on Jeju Island in South Korea.
