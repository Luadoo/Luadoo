# 👋👋 Hello there, I'm Jie Xu

## 1) Latent Representation


### Nice to meet you! 

I am a Chinese student pursuing a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at Ajou University in Korea. Since September 2021, I have been working under the supervision of Prof. Wonjun Hwang. My research interests during my Ph.D. studies include neural network quantization and knowledge distillation, utilizing the Information Theoretic Learning approach for image analysis. Before my Ph.D. study, I obtained my B.E. degree in Telecommunications and an M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Jeju National University. During my undergraduate studies, it was best, as I received three Korean National Scholarships. And my Ph.D. research is supported by the Brain Korea Scholarship.

### My recent research interests include uncertainty awareness of the deep compression model for diffusion models.
1. Model Compression/Acceleration:  Information theoretic learning, Neural network Pruning, Low-rank Approximation, Knowledge Distillation, and Binary Neural Network, Signal processing.
2. Image-related tasks: Image classification, diffusion model.
3. Presented in 2024.8.25 - [2024.8月报告会.pptx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16902694/2024.8.pptx)

Also, I am fond of mountaineering 🗻 and photography 📸. I have visited several mountains in my hometown, including 'Huang Shan - 黄山', 'Zi Peng Shan - 紫蓬山', and 'Xiao Bie Shan - 小别山', all located in Anhui Province. Besides, I have been to '한라산 - 汉拿山' three times on Jeju Island in South Korea.
